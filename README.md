# Custom-Object-Detection
A YOLO-based object detection model for 10 classes, including Apple, Dog, and Car. Built using a 6,136-image dataset processed via RoboFlow.ai, with class-based naming for detections and scripts for preprocessing, training, and inference. Developed with Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.

## Features
- **Custom Dataset**: A dataset of 6,136 images processed and augmented using RoboFlow.ai.
- **Classes**: Apple, Bike, Car, Cat, Dog, Human, Laptop, Orange, Truck, and Watch.
- **Detection**: Class-based image naming for detected objects.
- **Scripts**:
  - Preprocessing: Scripts for preparing the dataset.
  - Training: YOLO-based training for object detection.
  - Inference: Detection of objects in images or videos.

## Technologies Used
